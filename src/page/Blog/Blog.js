                    What are the difference between SQL and NoSQL?
                </div>
                <div className="collapse-content"> 
                    <p>
                    There are five practical differences between SQL and NoSQL:
                    <br />
                    1. Language:
                    SQL has been around for over 40 years, so it is recognizable, documented, and widely-used. Safe and versatile, itâ€™s particularly well suited for complex queries.
                    <br />
                    The dynamic schemata of NoSQL databases allow representation of alternative structures, often alongside each other, encouraging greater flexibility. There is less emphasis on planning, greater freedom when adding new attributes or fields, and the possibility of varied syntax across databases. 
                    <br />
                    2. Scalability:

                    Most SQL databases can be scaled vertically, by increasing the processing power of existing hardware. NoSQL databases use a master-slave architecture which scales better horizontally, with additional servers or nodes.
                    <br />
                    3. Structure:

                    SQL database schemata always represent relational, tabular data, with rules about consistency and integrity. They contain tables with columns (attributes) and rows (records), and keys have constrained logical relationships.

                    NoSQL databases need not stick to this format, but generally fit into one of four broad categories.
                    <br />
                    4. Properties:

                    At a high level, SQL and NoSQL comply with separate rules for resolving transactions.
                    <br />

                    5. Support and communities:

                    SQL databases represent massive communities, stable codebases, and proven standards. Multitudes of examples are posted online and experts are available to support those new to programming relational data.
                    <br />
                    NoSQL technologies are being adopted quickly, but communities remain smaller and more fractured. However, many SQL languages are proprietary or associated with large single-vendors, while NoSQL communities benefit from open systems and concerted commitment to onboarding users.

                    What is JWT, and how does it work?

                    JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) for securely transmitting information between parties as JSON object.
                    It is compact, readable and digitally signed using a private key/ or a public key pair by the Identity Provider(IdP). So the integrity and authenticity of the token can be verified by other parties involved.
                        <br />
                        Basically the identity provider(IdP) generates a JWT certifying user identity and Resource server decodes and verifies the authenticity of the token using secret salt / public key.
                        <br />
                        1.User sign-in using username and password or google/facebook. <br />
                        2.Authentication server verifies the credentials and issues a jwt signed using either a secret salt or a private key. <br />
                        3.User's Client uses the JWT to access protected resources by passing the JWT in HTTP Authorization header. <br />
                        4.Resource server then verifies the authenticity of the token using the secret salt/ public key.

                What is the difference between javascript and NodeJS?

                    1. JavaScript is a client-side scripting language that is lightweight, cross-platform, and interpreted. Both Java and HTML include it. Node.js, on the other hand, is a V8-based server-side programming language.
                        <br />
                        As a result, it is used to create network-centric applications. It's a networked system made for data-intensive real-time applications. If we compare node js vs. python, it is clear that node js will always be the preferred option.
                        <br />
                        2. JavaScript is a simple programming language that can be used with any browser that has the JavaScript Engine installed. Node.js, on the other hand, is an interpreter or execution environment for the JavaScript programming language. It requires libraries that can be conveniently accessed from JavaScript programming to be more helpful.
                        <br />
                        3. Any engine may run JavaScript. As a result, writing JavaScript is incredibly easy, and any working environment is similar to a complete browser. Node.js, on the other hand, only enables the V8 engine. Written JavaScript code, on the other hand, can run in any context, regardless of whether the V8 engine is supported.
                        <br />
                        4. A specific non-blocking operation is required to access any operating system. There are a few essential objects in JavaScript, but they are entirely OS-specific.
                        <br />
                        Node.js, on the other hand, can now operate non-blocking software tasks out of any JavaScript programming. It contains no OS-specific constants. Node.js establishes a strong relationship with the system files, allowing companies to read and write to the hard drive.
                        <br />
                        5. The critical benefits of JavaScript include a wide choice of interfaces and interactions and just the proper amount of server contact and direct visitor input.

                How does NodeJS handle multiple requests at the same time?
                </div>
                <div className="collapse-content"> 
                    <p>Most of the processing is handled in the node event loop. Node actually farms off the I/O work to threads. I/O operations typically take orders of magnitude longer than CPU operations so why have the CPU wait for that? Besides, the OS can handle I/O tasks very well already. In fact, because Node does not wait around it achieves much higher CPU utilisation.
                    <br />
                    By way of analogy, think of NodeJS as a waiter taking the customer orders while the I/O chefs prepare them in the kitchen. Other systems have multiple chefs, who take a customers order, prepare the meal, clear the table and only then attend to the next customer.</p>
